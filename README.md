# Persistent-To-Do-List
This application is a to-do list that helps the user to keep track of all the tasks that he/she needs to perform. The user can add or delete a task as per his/her convience.

This application is made using Javascript, HTML and CSS. CSS is used to style the application. The most part of this application is designed using JavaScript. Various concepts of JavaScript have been used for this particular application such as: 

1. Writing a modular code by dividing the code into different modules.

2. DOM manipulation to display the data on DOM.

3. To make the application persistent, concept of local storage has been used.

4. Input validation is performed such that only valid input will be allowed. Otherwise, an alert will be shown.

5. Error Handling is used to handle some of the common errors so that it prevents unnecessary lagging or termination of the application.

6. The application provides two buttons: (Completed and Delete) which will help the user to continously monitor the status of his/her task. When the task is completed, the user can chose to change its status either to complete or delete the task from the list. If the user chooses to change the status of the task as completed, he can click on the 'Completed' button which will create a strike-through over that particular task.

7. The application is made responsive using media queries.
